Welcome to my personal cybersecurity notes repository! I'm Alfred Cassidy, currently completing the Cybersecurity Certificate at NCSU. These notes are part of my ongoing journey toward becoming a SOC Analyst.

## 🔍 Topics Covered
- Network fundamentals and packet analysis
- SOC tools like Splunk and Wireshark
- Blue Team techniques and incident response
- Threat intelligence and MITRE ATT&CK
- Personal study notes from labs and courses

## 🧠 Why This Repo?
I use this space to organize concepts I’m learning, document labs and tool usage, and create quick references for myself and others.
